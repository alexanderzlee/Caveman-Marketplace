## Inspiration
Our team wanted to build an eCommerce website, and because the theme of the hackathon is Prehistoric, we built a marketplace where users and sellers can purchase and sell archeological finds. Our design and style welcome our users as cavemen when they enter the site. 

## What it does
This site allows people to buy and sell caveman items from the caveman marketplace. People can add different items to their cart and pay for items using PayPal. They can also add caveman items that they want to sell for their price.

## How we built it
We used Firebase for our storage and authentication. We used Redux in order to control the state between the products and the minecart

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into many challenges because firebase, our storage and authentication module, had updated and thus changed its syntax. We also struggled because some of our code editor sites like code sandbox did not work after a bit. We also had trouble with the GitHub and Netlify sites because it was our first time using a domain.com

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The accomplishments we are proud of are the authenticator usage, calculating total and billing to PayPal, using a database. The authenticator was an achievement because we were able to store data into an authenticator and manage website entry through preexisting accounts. The billing to PayPal was also another accomplishment for us because we were able to get the payment setup with relative ease. Lastly, using a database was another feat because we were able to store our data neatly and pull and display it with ease. 

## What we learned
We learned how to on developer knowledge about PayPal, collaborate better as a team, and utilize database within our website. With PayPal we learned how to connect the shipping and billing to our website, and other forms of payments. We learned how to better collaborate as a team because we were able to accommodate to the timing of others and all put in a fair share amount of work. Also, by using a database we were able to keep our data clean and organized for pushing, pulling, and displaying.

## What's next for CaveMan Adventures
If we were to further develop our web service, we would add more user-interaction functionalities such as a more enhanced shopping experience, and possibly integrating a communication system for sellers and buyers to interact.
